# reorganize the repo
- remove any tango support
- remove webvr-polyfill
- fix the testing, seems to have projection issue on image read, works on webcam tho
- import the new babylon.js port
- clean up data
- remove all the examples which are only demos.
  - maybe put them in a arjs-demos repository ?
